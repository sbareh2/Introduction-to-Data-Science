This course introduces the data analysis process and common statistical techniques necessary for the analysis of data. Students will ask questions that can be solved with a given data set, set up experiments, use statistics and data wrangling to test hypotheses, find ways to speed up their data analysis code, make their data set easier to access, and communicate their findings.
